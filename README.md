# Project-3
#This repo contains code for analyzing data colected from wearble computing devices. 

#The code merges data from training and test datasets, extracts mean and standard deviations for each measurement, renames variables and appropriately labels variable names. Finally, the dat creates a second datset containing independent tidy data with the average of each variable.

# The files are as follows:
#-Codebook.md:         Describes variables contained in the final output
#-Project-3-data.csv:  Final output of the analysis, a tidy dataset summarizing wearble technology dat
#-README.md:           Description of the repo and its files
#-run_analysis.R       R code used to derive the output from the raw data
