# Dataset
The run_analysis.R code creates a single tidy dataset, Project-3-data.csv, analyzing the output of wearable technology for a number of users. The data contains 20 variables with 180 observations each.

# Variables
The datset contains the following variables:
--Subject: This variable contains a unique ID number for each of the 30 users involved in the experiment
--Activity: This variable identifies which of six different physical activites the user engaged in (sitting, standing, laying, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, walking)
--The remaing variables contain the mean and standard deviation derived from the original data output from the wearable technology device for that combination of subject and activity.
